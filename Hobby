        My Favorite Hobbies
    </header>

    <p>Having a hobby is an important aspect of life. 
        It's part of what defines us. A hobby is an activity you enjoy in your free time, something that helps you relax, have fun, or learn new skills. 
        Whether it's reading, painting, playing sports, or collecting things, hobbies are a great way to unwind and express yourself. 
        They allow you to explore your interests and can even lead to discovering new passions!

    <p>Some of my hobbies include drawing, playing the piano, photography, etc.</p>
